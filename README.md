Code for the paper Tunable Quantum Neural Networks for Boolean Functions (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14122.pdf).

This project contains 2 classes found in code/circuits:
- Oracle implementing the oracle with the specific superposition
- TNN implementing the tunable quantum neural network

The training algorithm can be found in code/exact/train.py

run_stats.py will run the training for differeent functions and multiple runs.
